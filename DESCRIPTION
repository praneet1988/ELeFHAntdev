Description: Ensemble Learning for Harmonization and Annotation of Single Cells provides an easy to use interface for users to annotate clusters of single cells, harmonize labels across single cell datasets to generate a unified atlas and infer relationship among celltypes between two single cell datasets. It provides users with a flexibility of choosing a machine learning based classifiers or let ELeFHAnt automatically use the power of robust classifiers like randomForest and SVM (Support Vector Machines) to make predictions.
